Inteface for communication with NES controller

This unit generates a 1kHz clock for a controller. Also, a Parallel/Serial
control (PS) signal is generated (125Hz). After PS, the shift register in the 
gamepad will shift out data bits. These bits are read by the FPGA and then
provided at the output as parallel data.

NOTE: a special adapter board is used, since NES cotrollers operate at 5V and
Xilinx Spartan 3E board operates at 3.3V
