Reaction Timer

This module measures how fast a person can react. After a button is pressed,
LED will turn on after some random time. Player has to push the stop button
as fast as they can. The result is then shown on 7-segment displays.

Message LOL is displayed if stop is not pressed in a second.
Message FAIL is displayed if stop is pressed before the LED is on.
Message HI is displayed if no result is set (i.e. idle mode).
