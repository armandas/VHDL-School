The vga_sync module does all the synchronization work. Default settings are:
640x480 @ 60Hz.

Taken from "FPGA prototyping by VHDL examples" by P. Chu.
Timing values are taken from http://martin.hinner.info/vga/timing.html

The vga_test module shows:
    1px white border (outer)
    1px black border (inner)
    6 colours (rest of the area)
